## Hi, I’m Luke 👋

I’m a self-taught full-stack **software engineer** from the UK, currently completing a **Level 4 Software Engineering Apprenticeship** alongside my day job.

In my role, I work across **IT systems support and operations**, where I design and improve internal processes, automate workflows, and support business systems. This includes hands-on work with the **Microsoft ecosystem**, building both low-code and code-first solutions using Power Platform, scripting, APIs, and tools like **n8n** for event-driven automation. I’m particularly interested in system integration, workflow optimisation, and using AI tools to reduce operational friction and improve data quality.

### 🛠 Skills
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS
- **Other technologies:** React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, REST APIs, n8n, Microsoft Power Platform (Power Automate, Power Apps), Copilot, Git
